# Features

This page demonstrates **.txt file support** in statue-ssg!

## What's New

- 📝 Support for `.txt` files (in addition to `.md`)
- 🔝 Root-level content files appear in navigation
- ⚠️ Automatic conflict detection for naming conflicts

## How It Works

Just create a `.txt` file in your content directory with frontmatter, and it works like any markdown file!
