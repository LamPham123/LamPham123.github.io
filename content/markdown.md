# Markdown

This page demonstrates **root-level `.md` file support** in statue-ssg.

## How It Works

Place a `.md` file directly in the `content/` directory (not in a subdirectory) and it will automatically appear in the navigation bar.

## Formatting

Since this is a markdown file, you get full formatting support:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists like this one
- `inline code` and code blocks
- [Links](/) and images
- Headings, blockquotes, tables, and more

## Route

This file lives at `content/markdown.md` and is accessible at `/markdown`.
