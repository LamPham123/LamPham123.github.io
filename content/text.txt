Features

Statue SSG now supports plain .txt files alongside .md files. This page is itself a .txt file — no markdown, no frontmatter, just text.

Root-level .txt files like this one automatically appear in the navigation bar. The file name becomes the page title, so features.txt becomes "Features".

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. Single line breaks within a paragraph are kept as-is. No special syntax needed.

Text files are great for simple pages, notes, plain documentation, or any content where markdown formatting would just get in the way.

The content is HTML-escaped before rendering, so angle brackets and special characters are safe to use without escaping them yourself.
